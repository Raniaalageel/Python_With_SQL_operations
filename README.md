# Python_With_SQL_operations
A Python class with its properties and methods, that can connect to database and perform SQL operations (Select, Create, Update, Delete).

- I created a Python class connected to an SQLite database, allowing for SQL operations like selecting, creating, updating, and deleting records. This hands-on project demonstrated the power of object-oriented programming (OOP) in enhancing code modularity and reusability within a Python framework.
