# Python_With_SQL_operations
A Python class with its properties and methods, that can connect to database and perform SQL operations (Select, Create, Update, Delete).

I created a Python class connected to an SQLite database, allowing for SQL operations like selecting, creating, updating, and deleting records. This hands-on project demonstrated the power of object-oriented programming (OOP) in enhancing code modularity and reusability within a Python framework.

Python class have the following tasks :

* Task 1:

1. Showcase format(), join(), and strip() method usage.
2. Utilize Python loops (for and while) to read and print data points.
3. Demonstrate list and dict comprehension.
4. Implement a lambda function.
5. Create code to read and load data from a sample CSV into a Data Frame.
6. Explain the use of break and continue with code examples.
7. Illustrate usage of zip(), map(), and filter() methods.
8. Define higher-order functions and their significance, supported by code examples.
9. Develop a Python class with properties and methods for database connectivity and SQL operations (Select, Create, Update, Delete).

* Task 2:

1. Design a Python function to detect Fridays on the 13th of a month.
2. Create a Python function that converts ASCII characters to hexadecimal strings.
3. Craft a Python function to find the extra character in a reordered string.
4. Implement a function to calculate the difference between the largest and smallest numbers formed by digits in a given number.

* Task 3:

1. Formulate an SQL query to retrieve "FIRST_NAME" in uppercase from the Worker table.
2. Create an SQL query to fetch unique DEPARTMENT values from the Worker table.
3. Write an SQL query to extract the first three characters of FIRST_NAME from the Worker table.
4. Develop an SQL query to find the position of 'a' in the name 'Amitabh' from the Worker table.
5. Construct an SQL query to print FIRST_NAME after removing trailing white spaces.
6. Design an SQL query to fetch unique DEPARTMENT values and display their lengths.
7. Create an SQL query to print FIRST_NAME with 'a' replaced by 'A'.
8. Write an SQL query to concatenate FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME with a space in between.
9. Formulate an SQL query to display Worker details sorted by FIRST_NAME in ascending and DEPARTMENT in descending order.
10. Craft an SQL query to print Worker details, excluding "Vipul" and "Satish" from the Worker table.
11. Create an SQL query to fetch Worker details with DEPARTMENT as "Admin".
12. Design an SQL query to print Worker details with FIRST_NAME containing 'a'.
13. Develop an SQL query to print Worker details with FIRST_NAME ending in 'h' and having six alphabets.
14. Construct an SQL query to print Worker details with SALARY between 100,000 and 500,000.
15. Formulate an SQL query to print Worker details for those who joined in Feb'2014.
16. Create an SQL query to fetch Worker names with salaries between 50,000 and 100,000.
17. Write an SQL query to print details of Workers who are also Managers.
18. Develop an SQL query to fetch duplicate records with matching data in some fields of a table.
19. Craft an SQL query to display the top N (e.g., 10) records of a table.
20. Formulate an SQL query to determine the Nth (e.g., N=5) highest salary from a table.
